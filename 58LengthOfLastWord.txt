

Given a string s consisting of some words separated by some number of spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.

Example 2:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

Example 3:
Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.
 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        k=s.strip()
        c=0
        for x in k[::-1]:
            if(x!=' '):
                c+=1
            else:
                return c
        return c
